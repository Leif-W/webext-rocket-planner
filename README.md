# Known Issues

- The Swimlane Flow Diagram finds the most icons using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), not the desktop app or the VSC extension.
- The .drawio file format is not rendered in the browser on GitHub, so I exported as an SVG file format.
- The draw.io app saves the file with a white label background for the 2nd and 3rd lane icon label. Manually edit style in VSC using the VSC draw.io extension.
- The chosen app icon is not displayed on GitHub as the original file is located on the [Icon Finder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) website and 3rd party images are blocked by my browser, GitHub, or the document.
- The manually downloaded and exported SVG image for the website icon is not properly displayed with a local reference.
- Hard coded the URL to the website.svg file using the raw GitHub URL, which is ugly and brittle. If the file is moed in the repo, the URL must be manually updated. Ew.
